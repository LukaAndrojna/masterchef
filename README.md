# Masterchef simulator
## Intro
We were watching Masterchef one afternoon and we were discussing how a
slightly above average contestant that has isn't too ambitios can go
very far in the competition. Since the contestants that usually get eliminated usually perform better but then make a terrible plate due to too much ambition and some bad luck.

This is a simulation to determine what the distribution could look like provided certain assumptions.
